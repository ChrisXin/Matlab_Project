# Matlab_Project
These are some functions/scripts that I developed to perform computation or data analysis 


For Matlab Code:
- All functions are globally defined and are not part of any class,
- The types of the variables need not be defined,
- The return value is explicitly stated and assigned to,
- The name of the file must be the name of the function suffixed with .m, and
- The function starts with the keyword function and ends with the keyword end.
- There are a few further restrictions on the name of a function or variable: it must start with a letter or an underscore and the rest of the characters must be either letters, numbers, or underscores.
